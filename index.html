  <p>
    I am a front end developer with 4+ years of building single page applications.

    I have built several large applications in AngularJS.
    I have some experience with React and Redux, but mainly <a href="https://github.com/mcranston18/reacting">personal projects</a>,
    though I would like to use those tools more.
    Currently, I am building a <a href="https://github.com/mcranston18/freshclone">rest API in using Django Rest Framework</a>.
